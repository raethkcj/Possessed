# Possessed

This addon emulates retail WoW's possession bar by replacing your primary actions with your pet's actions while you have a creature possessed. This allows you to use your primary hotkeys for your pet's actions.

Fully supports the following possessions regardless of combat:
* Priest's Mind Control
* Hunter's Eyes of the Beast
* The Orb in Razorgore the Untamed's encounter
* The Orbs in the Kil'jaeden encounter
* Experimental support for Teron Gorefiend's Shadow of Death.

Supports *all* other possessions that start outside of combat. However, if you do get into combat, it can only restore your regular action bar if the pet dies or despawns. If something else stops the possession, you still be stuck with its action bar until you leave combat. (This caveat does not apply to the fully supported possessions above; you can safely start them in or out of combat).

It works with default Blizzard action bars, and should work with any action bar addon that uses Blizzard's default ActionButtons 1-10 for its primary action bar. I use it with Dominos.
