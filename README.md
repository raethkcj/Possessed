# Possessed

This addon emulates retail WoW's possession bar by replacing your primary actions with your pet's actions while you have a creature possessed. This allows you to use your primary hotkeys for your pet's actions.

Currently works with the following possessions:
* Priest's Mind Control
* Hunter's Eyes of the Beast
* The Orb in Razorgore the Untamed's encounter
* The Orbs in the Kil'jaeden encounter

It works with default Blizzard action bars, and should work with any action bar addon that uses Blizzard's default ActionButtons 1-10 for its primary action bar. I use it with Dominos.
